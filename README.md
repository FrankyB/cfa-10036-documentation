cfa-10036-documentation
=========================

This repository contains sourcecode to learn by example, and a simple library to learn from as well. It contains an API doc listing all of the functions in the library, and will soon contain a copy of all the documentaion for the 10036. It does infact contain all of the examples that documentation teaches off of, so in one way the code is the documentation.
